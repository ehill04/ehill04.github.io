1. All of my code was validated and works through testing with my browser.
2. I didn't collaborate with anyone, but I used w3schools.com to help me
   understand certain css aspecte by using explicit examples
3. It took me about 3 hours to create a plan for and write my code, and about
   an hour and a half to figure out how to put everything on github
